# Cal Train Ice cream finder app

This project is written in Javascript and HTML and uses 3rd party APIs such as Google maps and Foursquare to list the names of caltrain stations between San Francisco and San Jose and get the nearest ice cream parlours for each place on selection. The index.html file when run in browser displays the list of caltrain stations on the left with their respective maps on the right.

The input text box can be used to search for and filter locations within the list.

Finally, on click of the location from the list, the ice cream centers are displayed. As of now, only names are displayed. Addresses and image may be added in future.
